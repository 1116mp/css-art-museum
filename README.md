# css-art-museum
Welcome to the CSS Art Museum â€“ an open-source initiative where creativity meets code! ðŸ’«  This project is a digital gallery dedicated to showcasing artworks created with only HTML &amp; CSS. The idea is simple: every contributor adds their own CSS creation, and together we build a growing museum of styles, colors, and imagination.
